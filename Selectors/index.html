        <p>
          An element selector (also known as a type selector or tag name
          selector) is a <span class="highlight">CSS selector</span> used to select and apply styles to all
          HTML elements that have a specific element name.

          Thinking A class selector is a CSS rule that targets elements using a
          period (.) followed by a specific class name. Unlike IDs, classes are
          reusable and can be applied to multiple elements across a single
          webpage. They allow for consistent styling of grouped items and can
          even be combined on a single element for modular design. It is the
          most common method for applying styles in modern web development.

        <h2>ID selector</h2>
        <p class="highlight">
          An ID selector is a CSS rule that targets a specific element using a
          hash symbol (#) followed by a unique identifier. Unlike classes, an ID
          must be unique to a single element on a webpage, making it ideal for
          distinct sections like headers or footers. It carries higher
          specificity than class selectors, meaning its styles will override
          conflicting class-based rules. Because of this precision, it is also
          the most common method for selecting elements in JavaScript
